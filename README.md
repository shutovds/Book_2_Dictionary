# Book_2_Dictionary

Introduction
=============

This program was made to help people to study language.
When we start reading the books in foreign language we ussualy meet a lot of new words and it is difficult to understand
which of them are more important for studying and which are less important.

This program should help to solve the problem.
You can download the script of the book or article, that you read, to the program, it will analyse it and calculate
the frequency for each word in your book/article. Then you can choose option 'analyze the book' and compile your own
dictionary based on the most common words of the book.

After that you can study this dictionary and you can be sure that you study most common words in
this book/article/subject. You also can use 'Ignore' dictionary to set words, that you already know to ignore.
Ignore words won't be shown in the future for the book analysis.
